## Description
**Circle Clicker** is a simple Java project brought to life with the libGDX framework, providing a glimpse of rhythmic gaming inspired by _osu!_, using osu beatmap file format While it doesn't aspire to be a full-fledged game, Circle Clicker brings a bit of casual fun and rhythm into your gaming experience.

<strong>Please remember that Circle Clicker is not a full-fledged game, but rather a demo showcasing my initial foray into game development. It does not use parameters like circle size, approach rate e.t.c. For the real experience check out [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home)</strong>
 

## Key Features

* Load maps from osu!
	- Choose the music You like
	- Challenge yourself by trying out different difficulty levels to suit your skill
	
 * Aim and click circles to the beat
	 - Test your precision and timing by clicking circles in perfect rhythm, aiming to hit them before they disappear
	 - Strive for flawless timing and accuracy to achieve the highest score possible
* Earn Points Based on Timing
	- Get 300, 100, or 50 points from a single hit, depending on how closely you time your click to the circle's rhythm
	- Don't miss a beat, or you'll break your combo and lose out on score multiplier
