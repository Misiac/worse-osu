## Description
**Circle Clicker** is a simple Java project brought to life with the libGDX framework, providing a glimpse of rhythmic gaming inspired by _osu!_, using osu beatmap file format. While it doesn't aspire to be a full-fledged game, Circle Clicker brings a bit of casual fun and rhythm into your gaming experience.

<strong>Please remember that Circle Clicker is not a full-fledged game, but rather a demo showcasing my initial foray into game development. It does not use parameters like circle size, approach rate e.t.c. For the real experience check out [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home)</strong>
